# Folder Structure

# Introduction
- Should use this sort of data to render the files with icons ( optional: use SVG icons from
Web ).
- Folders should be expandable, When you left click on a file, it should have some
active/selected state.
- On right click on files a popup opens and you should allow copy, deletion and rename of
the files. ( for now console log the file name and the event.i.e copy, delete, rename )

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- TypeScript

## Performance Improvements

- Used `useMemo` hook to avoid re-renders & cache state value.
- Used `useCallback` hook to prevent redefinition on each render, reducing unnecessary re-renders.
